                <p>HIGANTES FESTIVAL</p>
                <p>The Higantes Festival is a local festival held annually In Angono, Rizal, Philippines, where hundreds
                    of giant papier-mâché puppets are paraded, representing the common people's mockery of the bad
                    hacienda owners of the past during Spanish colonial rule.
                    In present celebrations, the Angono townsfolk continue to build higantes to represent each barangay
                    (village) for the festival's parade. Many forms of the puppets have been made, in accordance to the
                    specialization of a village. For example, a village famous for their balut delicacy, would create a
                    higante with a duck-shaped head. Majority of the giant puppets, however, continue to have human
                    heads, with varying size and shapes. Over time, the number of puppets used during the parade have
                    increased to more than a hundred.

                <p>MASSKARA FESTIVAL</p>
                <p>If you miss the big festivals in Visayas in February, attend the MassKara Festival in Bacolod. It
                    happens much later in the year, on the 4th Sunday of October.
                    MassKara came from the Filipino word maskara or mask. It’s also a portmanteau of mass and cara (face
                    in Spanish) to mean “multitude of faces”.
                    MassKara Festival is known for its street parties, with the biggest party, known as Masskaraland.
                    Masskaraland is open for everyone who wants to join the fun. Partygoers can dance from sunrise until
                    sunset, as they turn the street of Lacson into a gigantic party venue.
                    As The City of Smiles, expect Bacolod locals to give you the warmest welcome. Festivals in the
                    Philippines usually bring out the most hospitable spirit in everyone, so don't be shy to befriend
                    locals during the festivities. You might even get the best travel tips from them!
                    The music used for the celebration has enjoyed a colorful evolution, just like the festival. From
                    folk songs, the festival now uses a combination of Latin beat remixes as well as Philippine Jazz to
                    grace the street dances.

                <p>KADAYAWAN FESTIVAL</p>
                <p>Kadayawan Festival is arguably the most prominent festival in Mindanao. It’s held in the capital,
                    Davao City, on the 3rd week of August.
                    The festival highlights the indigenous tribes of Mindanao. It features events such as Indak-Indak sa
                    Kadalanan where communities dance on the streets wearing indigenous attires.
                    There’s also Dula Kadayawan. Here, Moro and Lumad tribes come together to play indigenous games,
                    including spear throwing.
                    The Kadayawan Festival is Davao City’s annual festival, which celebrates life and thanksgiving for
                    nature’s bounty, the wealth of culture, the bounties of harvest and serenity of living. The
                    festival’s name is taken from the Mandaya word “Madayaw” which means “valuable”, “good” and
                    “beautiful.”
                    It was said that during the olden times, the tribes living in the foothills of Mt Apo would hold a
                    thanksgiving feast to thank the creator for their bountiful harvests.
