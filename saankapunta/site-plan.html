      <h3>Festivals</h3>
      <p>
        The Philippines are well-known for their annual celebrations and distinctive events. People display their agricultural products and celebrate the town festivals every year in a stunning array of colors.
      </p>
      
      <p>HIGANTES FESTIVAL</p>
      <p>The Higantes Festival is a local festival held annually In Angono, Rizal, Philippines, where hundreds of giant papier-mâché puppets are paraded, representing the common people's mockery of the bad hacienda owners of the past during Spanish colonial rule.
        In present celebrations, the Angono townsfolk continue to build higantes to represent each barangay (village) for the festival's parade. Many forms of the puppets have been made, in accordance to the specialization of a village. For example, a village famous for their balut delicacy, would create a higante with a duck-shaped head. Majority of the giant puppets, however, continue to have human heads, with varying size and shapes. Over time, the number of puppets used during the parade have increased to more than a hundred.
      </p>

      <p>MASSKARA FESTIVAL</p>
      <p>If you miss the big festivals in Visayas in February, attend the MassKara Festival in Bacolod. It happens much later in the year, on the 4th Sunday of October.
        MassKara came from the Filipino word maskara or mask. It’s also a portmanteau of mass and cara (face in Spanish) to mean “multitude of faces”.
        MassKara Festival is known for its street parties, with the biggest party, known as Masskaraland.
        Masskaraland is open for everyone who wants to join the fun. Partygoers can dance from sunrise until sunset, as they turn the street of Lacson into a gigantic party venue.
        As The City of Smiles, expect Bacolod locals to give you the warmest welcome. Festivals in the Philippines usually bring out the most hospitable spirit in everyone, so don't be shy to befriend locals during the festivities. You might even get the best travel tips from them!
        The music used for the celebration has enjoyed a colorful evolution, just like the festival. From folk songs, the festival now uses a combination of Latin beat remixes as well as Philippine Jazz to grace the street dances.        
      </p>  

      <p>KADAYAWAN FESTIVAL</p>
      <p>Kadayawan Festival is arguably the most prominent festival in Mindanao. It’s held in the capital, Davao City, on the 3rd week of August.
        The festival highlights the indigenous tribes of Mindanao. It features events such as Indak-Indak sa Kadalanan where communities dance on the streets wearing indigenous attires.
        There’s also Dula Kadayawan. Here, Moro and Lumad tribes come together to play indigenous games, including spear throwing.
        The Kadayawan Festival is Davao City’s annual festival, which celebrates life and thanksgiving for nature’s bounty, the wealth of culture, the bounties of harvest and serenity of living. The festival’s name is taken from the Mandaya word “Madayaw” which means “valuable”, “good” and “beautiful.”
        It was said that during the olden times, the tribes living in the foothills of Mt Apo would hold a thanksgiving feast to thank the creator for their bountiful harvests.
        The festival in its current form was first celebrated in 1986 as Apo Duwaling Festival, the name represents the city’s three icons: Mt Apo, Durian and the Waling-Waling orchid.  In 1988 during the term of then newly elected City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, it was renamed as Kadayawan.
        Today, the festival highlights the rich and diverse cultures of the City’s 11 ethnolinguistic communities that include the Bagobo Tagabawa, Klata, Ata, Matigsalug, Obo Manuvu, Maguindanaon, Iranun, Sama, Tausug, Kagan and the Maranao.
