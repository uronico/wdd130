    <p>Hello everyone, how are you? Let me introduce myself. I am 29 years old and I'm from the Philippines. Where you can find beautiful island/beaches to have a family vacation.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for 20 years. My favorite verse from the scripture will be found in The Book of Mormon on 1Nephi 3:7. This verse had the very large impact to my life because it serves as the way for me to become a full time missionary and serve the Lord.</p>
    <p>I am currently pursuing a software development degree as I love to explore and learn more about programming and develop my more of my skills. It has been an interest to me ever since I graduated from high school.</p>
    <p>Currrently, I am working as a virtual assistant for one year. Working has been my daily lifestyle since I get back on my mission. Now, I'm pursuing my studies so I can get a degree and find new job that suits for me and help my family.</p>
    <p>I love eating and to travel, even though I have travel sickness. I am looking forward on meeting and knowing all of you. Thank you.</p>
